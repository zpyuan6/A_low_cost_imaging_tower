# A_low_cost_imaging_tower
## Intro
A low cost Raspberry pi powered imaging tower and analyses tools for detecting *Heterodera schachtii* on *Arabidopsis thaliana*.

## Contents
This repository contains all the 3D files to make and construct the housing of the components of the imaging tower and scripts to analyse these images. 

	1) Image tower 3D files:
  a: If you own an ultimaker S3 with an AA 0.4 core, PLA and a BB core with PVA, you can use the presliced files: A_low_cost_imaging_tower/Ultimaker S3 CURA sliced/
  b: If you own another 3D printer, or want to use a printing service, you can use the files in A_low_cost_imaging_tower/STL files/ to generate sliced files for printing. 
  Note: the slicing for our files is done in Ultimakers CURA software, which also works for some non Ultimaker printers.
  
  2) Assembly of the tower.
